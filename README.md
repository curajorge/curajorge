## About

7+ years building high-availability payment processors, developer tooling, and distributed systems. Language agnostic by design — deep roots in .NET, but I pick the right runtime for the problem: **Rust** for local-first performance, **Python** for data pipelines, **C#** for enterprise stability. Everything I ship is **idempotent, fault-tolerant, and observable**.

## Experience

**Senior Software Engineer** | **InComm Payments** | *<!-- dates, e.g. 2022 – Present -->*
- Designed custom idempotency layers for payment orchestration, preventing double-charges across network retries
- Led zero-downtime migration from legacy monolith to modular Vue 3 micro-frontends
- Built and maintained high-throughput transaction processing services on .NET

**Software Engineer** | **RT²** | *<!-- dates, e.g. 2019 – 2022 -->*
- Developed payment rails handling millions in monthly transaction volume
- Implemented event-sourced architectures with distributed locking (RedLock) for consistency guarantees
- Drove adoption of CI/CD pipelines and containerized deployments (Docker, GitHub Actions)

I treat coffee brewing like a deployment pipeline — precise variables, consistent execution, constant debugging. Following the James Hoffmann school of thought.

| Method | Dose | Water | Grind | Key Step |
