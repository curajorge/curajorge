### `> whoami`

Senior engineer with 7+ years building distributed systems that other engineers depend on. I've shipped high-volume payment infrastructure processing $50M+ annually, led production migrations without downtime, and recently focused on developer tooling and AI-assisted workflows.

I am **language agnostic** by design. Whether it's **Rust** for local-first performance, **Python** for agent orchestration, or **C#** for enterprise stability, I focus on building **idempotent, fault-tolerant systems** regardless of the stack.

I care about how systems interact, why builds break, and making the path to production shorter.

## `0x02` // Build Artifacts

### 🎙️ **Kora-Next** — Voice Agent Framework
*Enterprise voice agents with real-time audio streaming.*
* **The Tech:** Python, FastAPI, Twilio Media Streams, Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio, WebSockets.
* **The Engineering:** Architected a low-latency voice agent framework handling bidirectional audio streaming for natural, interruptible conversations. Built a stateful Orchestrator engine for multi-turn context, agent routing, and tool execution. Engineered an async "Intervention Observer" pattern that analyzes stream metadata for hotwords and negative sentiment in real-time without blocking the conversational loop.

### 🧠 **Customer Sentiment Analyzer**
*LLM-powered customer intelligence — zero code, pure knowledge architecture.*
* **The Tech:** 10-agent research team, 30+ academic sources (Bing Liu, Kahneman, Fitzpatrick, Kleppmann).
* **The Engineering:** Built a domain-specific AI skill with 27 analytical rules, 7-step methodology, RICE-scored recommendations, journey-stage mapping, competitive intelligence extraction, and cognitive bias detection. Demonstrates what AI-native product analysis looks like vs traditional NLP pipelines.

### ⚡ **Context Engineering App** — Local-First Developer Tooling
*Bridging the gap between local filesystems and LLM reasoning.*
* **The Tech:** Rust (Backend), Tauri v2, Vue 3, Tiktoken-rs, axum, SSE.
* **The Engineering:** Built a cross-platform desktop app for assembling AI prompts from codebases. Embedded an MCP server (JSON-RPC 2.0 over SSE) directly inside the Tauri binary — Claude Code connects to the running app and gets access to file scanning, prompt assembly, token counting, and clipboard through the same Rust engine the GUI uses. No external processes.

### 📺 **SignStream** — Digital Signage Platform
*Cloud-native content delivery for the restaurant industry.*
* **The Tech:** Cloud-first architecture, real-time device management, billing integration.
* **The Engineering:** Founding software engineer. Architected the platform from MVP to production — backend technology decisions, real-time device management, content delivery pipelines, and billing integration. Currently serving paying customers.

### 🌐 **MoreSpeakers.com** — Open Source
*Security-first authentication and AI-driven engineering standards.*
* **The Tech:** .NET 10, ASP.NET Core, WebAuthn/FIDO2, AI Agents.
* **The Engineering:** Implemented a passwordless authentication system, designed the public key infrastructure, and patched a critical security vulnerability. Built a multi-agent AI architecture to standardize engineering processes. Engineered a GitHub integration service with intelligent caching reducing external API calls by ~95%.

### 💳 **Enterprise Payment Orchestration**
*Building rails for millions in transactions.*
* **Resilience:** Designed custom idempotency layers ensuring network retries never result in double-charges. Processing $50M+ annually with 99.99% uptime.
* **Migration:** Led zero-downtime migrations from legacy monoliths to modular Vue 3 micro-frontends serving 5,000+ daily active users.

## `0x03` // System.Runtime.Caffeine ☕

I treat coffee brewing like a deployment pipeline: precise variables, consistent execution, constant debugging. James Hoffmann school of thought — maximizing extraction without hitting astringency.

```yaml
# The Daily Driver (Aeropress)
config: { method: Standard, ratio: "11g : 200g", grind: Medium-Fine, temp: 100°C }
steps: [Pour 200g, Wait 2:00, Swirl, Press at 2:30 — stop at the hiss]
```
